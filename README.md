# ACLR-Patients-KCFs-Prediction
  The project is implemented in Python and includes a CNN layer, a BiGRU layer, and a Self-Attention layer. By inputting joint angles and acceleration data from three lower limb joints of ACLR patients across three planes of motion, it can accurately predict knee joint contact forces in patients.
  You can try to run this project with the test dataset.
